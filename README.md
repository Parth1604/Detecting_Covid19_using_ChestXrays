# Detecting_Covid19_using_ChestXrays
The goal of the project is to create a system that can accurately and efficiently detect the presence of COVID-19 in chest X-ray images. The main objective is to assist healthcare professionals in several important aspects of dealing with the disease.

Firstly, the system aims to aid in the early diagnosis of COVID-19. By analyzing chest X-ray images, it can identify specific patterns or abnormalities associated with the virus, enabling healthcare professionals to quickly identify potential cases. Early diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment and isolation of infected individuals, which helps prevent the further spread of the disease.

Secondly, the system aims to facilitate rapid triage of patients. Triage involves prioritizing patients based on the severity of their condition. By accurately detecting COVID-19 in chest X-ray images, the system can help healthcare professionals swiftly identify patients who require immediate medical attention. This allows for a more efficient allocation of resources and ensures that critical cases receive prompt care.

Lastly, the system aims to contribute to the effective management of COVID-19 patients. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, the system can provide valuable information to healthcare professionals about the extent and severity of lung involvement. This information assists in determining appropriate treatment plans and monitoring disease progression. By providing reliable and timely insights, the system enhances the overall care and management of COVID-19 patients.

These technologies and libraries work together to create an effective and efficient environment for developing and training deep learning models for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

## limitations
+ Due to the scarcity of open-source data, the dataset used in this project is imbalanced, primarily consisting of one class, which is COVID-19. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were not applied to the dataset as applying image augmentation techniques to medical images, such as X-ray images used for detecting serious diseases like COVID-19, should be done with caution. Image augmentation involves applying transformations to the images, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping, to increase the diversity of the training data. While augmentation can be beneficial in improving the performance of deep learning models by reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization, it is important to consider the nature of the medical images and the specific task at hand.

+ In the case of medical imaging, altering the appearance of the images through augmentation can potentially introduce biases or distortions that affect the accuracy of the disease detection. Medical images often contain subtle features or patterns that medical professionals rely on for accurate diagnosis. Applying random transformations may modify these critical features, leading to misleading results and potentially compromising the model's effectiveness.
